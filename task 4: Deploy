Task 4: Deployment

Build Your Application:
Before deploying, you need to build your application. In your project directory, run:


npm run build
This will generate the build files in the dist or build directory (depending on the configuration).

Choose a Hosting Provider:
You mentioned that you prefer to use Vercel. If you're using Vercel:

Install the Vercel CLI globally:

npm install -g vercel
Deploy to Vercel:

Open your terminal and navigate to your project's build folder:

cd dist
Run the following command to deploy to Vercel:

vercel
The Vercel CLI will guide you through the deployment process. It will ask you to log in or sign up, and then it will deploy your application.
Once the deployment is complete, Vercel will provide you with a URL where your application is live.
Access Your Deployed Application:

Visit the URL provided by your hosting provider (e.g., Vercel) to access your deployed React application.
